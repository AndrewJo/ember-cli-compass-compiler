## ember-cli-compass-compiler

This addon adds compass compiler for Ember CLI.

### Installation

In your Ember CLI app (>= v0.0.37) run the following:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-compass-compiler
```

### Usage

After installation everything should work automatically.

A file named `appname.scss` in your `app/styles` directory should be compiled into `appname.css` 
with `ember build` or `ember serve` commands.
